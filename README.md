srlRaceWatcher
==============

A webpage to view streams from an SRL race in a compact format

Set the url param "race" to the id of the SRL race

Set the url param "me" to your twitch name to make it so it doesn't stream yourself if you're in the race

Set the url param "blocked" to a comma-separated list of other twitch usernames that you don't want to be included (perhaps they asked you not to restream them)

Set the url params "w" and "h" to control the size of the grid. It's 2x3 by default
